            <h3>Manusath Mehewara (January, 2021)</h3>
            <p>Hands for Smile as a community organization planned a programme to donate essential
                food items to families in need. Specially, given the consequences of the the ongoing
                economic crisis due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it was noticed that significant fraction of
                the population was dealing with the difficulty to afford essential food supply. As a
                measure to support families dealing with financial difficulties during the pandemic,
                Mansuath Mehewara project was conducted. During this project, families in need were
                identified, essential food items were collected, packaged and, distributed to the identified
                families. </p>
